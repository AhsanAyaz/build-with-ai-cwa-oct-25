# AI-Powered Full Stack App Development Workshop with Firebase Studio & Gemini Code Assist

## 1. Introduction

Welcome, innovators! This workshop will guide you through building a full-stack, AI-powered application using Firebase Studio and Gemini Code Assist. You'll go from a simple prompt to a production-ready application, leveraging the power of generative AI to accelerate your development process.

The goal is to focus on **what** you want to build, rather than getting bogged down in the **how**. By the end of this session, you will have a deployed application and a solid understanding of how to use these cutting-edge tools.

## 2. The Challenge: From "localhost" to Live

We've all had countless projects that never made it past our local machines. Today, we break that cycle. This workshop is about turning your ideas into reality and getting them deployed for the world to see.

## 3. Core Technologies

*   **Firebase Studio:** An integrated and extensible agentic workspace designed for building, running, and managing web apps, cross-platform mobile apps, and backend services. It's a web-based environment built on VS Code, providing a seamless development experience with deep Google integrations, preconfigured environments, and a full cloud VM.
*   **Gemini Code Assist:** Your AI-powered coding assistant. It helps with a variety of tasks including coding, debugging, testing, and refactoring, all while interacting with your codebase.
*   **Genkit:** An open-source framework by Google for building full-stack, AI-powered applications. It provides a unified interface for integrating various AI models and simplifies the creation of features like chatbots and recommendation systems.

## 4. Workshop Requirements

Your mission is to create a unique, full-stack application that meets the following criteria:

### 4.1. AI-Powered Feature
Your application must include a meaningful AI-powered feature. When you prompt Firebase Studio, be sure to ask for an AI use case. This will automatically integrate a generative AI model into your project.

### 4.2. Database Persistence
Your application needs to store and retrieve data. By prompting for a feature that requires data storage (e.g., user profiles, saved items), Firebase Studio will automatically include and configure Firestore, a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database.

### 4.3. The `/about` Route
Every application must have an `/about` page that includes:
*   **Your App's Idea:** A brief and clear description of what your application does.
*   **Description:** A more detailed explanation of your app's features and purpose.
*   **Team Members:** The names of all team members.
*   **GitHub URL (Optional but Recommended):** A link to the project's GitHub repository.

This information will be automatically scraped to showcase all the projects built during this workshop.

## 5. Collaboration and Teamwork

You will be working in breakout rooms with a maximum of **five** team members per room. While you all have GCP credits, we highly encourage you to collaborate. Working in a team is a critical skill that recruiters look for, and this is a great opportunity to showcase your ability to work with others.

Each breakout room has a capacity of six, allowing a mentor to join and provide assistance when needed.

## 6. Getting Started: From Prompt to Production

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the development process you'll be following:

1.  **Ideation:** In your breakout rooms, brainstorm and decide on an application idea. Remember to incorporate an AI feature and a need for data persistence.
2.  **Prompting Firebase Studio:** Craft a detailed prompt that describes the application you want to build. The more specific you are, the better the initial generated application will be.
3.  **Refining with Gemini Code Assist:** Once your application is generated, use Gemini Code Assist to refine the code, add new features (like the `/about` page), and fix any issues. You can interact with it through natural language.
4.  **Testing and Iteration:** Use the live preview in Firebase Studio to test your application. Work with your team and mentors to iterate on your design and functionality.
5.  **Deployment:** When you are satisfied with your application, use the built-in tools in Firebase Studio to deploy it to production.

## 7. Mentorship

Mentors will be circulating through the breakout rooms to answer your questions and provide guidance. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck.
